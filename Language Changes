So, in Java there are wrapper classes for primitive data types that allow you 
to treat the primitive types like objects, and it is required for the ArrayList 
data type to use objects, not primitive types when specifying what type you are 
using. It is somewhat bothersome to me that I can't use a primitive type for 
ArrayLists so I think I would change that.

Also, this doesn't exactly answer the question, but I would like it to be 
easier/more intuitive to set up a programming environment in VSCode for 
using different languages. Some languages won't work with WSL as the terminal, 
but others do and it would be nice to be able to set different default terminals 
for each language.
